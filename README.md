# Code Quiz

This project involves creating a timed, interactive multiple choice quiz using the JavaScript fundamentals taught thus far. It also features a dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap components that adapt the user's screen size. As a beginner developer, this serves as a great practice in creating a coding assessment that will no doubt be assigned as I progress down the developer field and will likely feature other elements besides multiple choice. Using JavaScript, this project contains unique functionality such as a timer, local storage to store user scores and names, creating and appending HTML elements on the quiz, event listeners for user responses, etc. To ensure that I create the appropriate application, I followed the user story and criteria as shown below so that it functions correctly. 

## User Story

```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
